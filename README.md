## UMLer

Generates simple class UMLs, that you can export to Word directly.

The source code is all in `src/main/java/ca/momoperes/umler`, if you want to try understanding it :^)

### How to use

1. Download and install Java (obviously), doesn't need to be in your path
2. Download [UMLer.jar](https://momoperes.ca/files/UMLer.jar)
3. Double-click / run that JAR file using Java
4. Drag your `.java` file into the area. You should see the UML
5. Click Export to Word and select where to export it
